Juniper vLabs Lab 5 (Network Address Translation, Source NAT to using IP Pools)

Step By Step Guide:

1) Login to vLabs and Reserve/Launch the Lab (should take a few minutes to start up).
    - https://jlabs.juniper.net/vlabs/portal/zones-policies/

2) Lets start by changing the IP addresses on the interfaces between the vSRX and Host3.

Host3:
delete interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 family inet address 10.100.13.2/24 
set interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 0 family inet address 200.0.13.2/30


vSRX:
delete interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 family inet address 10.100.13.1/24
set interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 0 family inet address 200.0.13.1/30

3) We do this to simulate the connection between Host3 and the vSRX being a publicly routed, external subnet. Now lets add a 
static route in Host1 so that it knows how to reach the external subnet of 200.0.13.0/30 through the firewall. We will also try 
to ping from Host1 to Host3.

jcluser@Host1# set routing-options static route 200.0.13.0/30 next-hop 10.100.11.1

jcluser@Host1> ping 200.0.13.2 rapid count 5    
PING 200.0.13.2 (200.0.13.2): 56 data bytes
.....
--- 200.0.13.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

4) We see that the pings have failed, lets do a security flow session on the vSRX to troubleshoot.

jcluser@vSRX1> show security flow session | refresh    
---(refreshed at 2024-04-08 23:56:51 UTC)---
Session ID: 256, Policy name: default-permit/5, State: Stand-alone, Timeout: 54, Valid
  In: 10.100.11.2/9506 --> 200.0.13.2/0;icmp, Conn Tag: 0x0, If: ge-0/0/0.0, Pkts: 1, Bytes: 84, 
  Out: 200.0.13.2/0 --> 10.100.11.2/9506;icmp, Conn Tag: 0x0, If: ge-0/0/2.0, Pkts: 0, Bytes: 0, 

5) 5) We see that the vSRX is showing packets enter in from Host1, but we do not see any replies from Host3. Lets look at Host3's 
routing table.

jcluser@Host3> show route 

inet.0: 5 destinations, 5 routes (5 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

0.0.0.0/0          *[Static/5] 00:39:23
                    > to 100.123.0.1 via fxp0.0
100.123.0.0/16     *[Direct/0] 00:39:23
                    > via fxp0.0
100.123.1.2/32     *[Local/0] 00:39:23
                      Local via fxp0.0
200.0.13.0/30       *[Direct/0] 00:26:41
                    > via ge-0/0/2.0
200.0.13.2/32       *[Local/0] 00:26:41
                      Local via ge-0/0/2.0

6) As we can see, Host3 doesn't have any private IP subnets listed in its route table, and the default route is setup in the lab 
through fxp0.0 most likely for reachbility through the management network to the device. This is a normal configuration. Lets now 
setup a NAT policy on the firewall to perform NAT on its external interface so that traffic sourced from Host1 (10.100.11.2) now 
shows up sourced from the firewalls external interface towards Host3 in the UNTRUST zone (200.0.0.1 - ge-0/0/2.0).
