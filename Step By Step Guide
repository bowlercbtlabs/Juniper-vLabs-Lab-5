Juniper vLabs Lab 5 (Network Address Translation, Source NAT using IP Pools)

Step By Step Guide:

1) Login to vLabs and Reserve/Launch the Lab (should take a few minutes to start up).
    - https://jlabs.juniper.net/vlabs/portal/zones-policies/

2) Lets start by changing the IP addresses on the interfaces between the vSRX and Host3.

Host3:
delete interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 family inet address 10.100.13.2/24 
set interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 0 family inet address 200.0.13.2/30


vSRX:
delete interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 family inet address 10.100.13.1/24
set interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 0 family inet address 200.0.13.1/30

3) We do this to simulate the connection between Host3 and the vSRX being a publicly routed, external subnet. Now lets add a 
static route in Host1 so that it knows how to reach the external subnet of 200.0.13.0/30 through the firewall. We will also try 
to ping from Host1 to Host3.

jcluser@Host1# set routing-options static route 200.0.13.0/30 next-hop 10.100.11.1

jcluser@Host1> ping 200.0.13.2 rapid count 5    
PING 200.0.13.2 (200.0.13.2): 56 data bytes
.....
--- 200.0.13.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

4) We see that the pings have failed, lets do a security flow session on the vSRX to troubleshoot.

jcluser@vSRX1> show security flow session 
Session ID: 21, Policy name: default-permit/5, State: Stand-alone, Timeout: 54, Valid
  In: 10.100.11.2/6434 --> 200.0.13.2/0;icmp, Conn Tag: 0x0, If: ge-0/0/0.0, Pkts: 1, Bytes: 84, 
  Out: 200.0.13.2/0 --> 10.100.11.2/6434;icmp, Conn Tag: 0x0, If: ge-0/0/2.0, Pkts: 0, Bytes: 0, 

5) We see that the vSRX is showing packets enter in from Host1, but we do not see any replies from Host3. Lets look at Host3's 
routing table.

jcluser@Host3> show route 

inet.0: 5 destinations, 5 routes (5 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

0.0.0.0/0          *[Static/5] 00:39:23
                    > to 100.123.0.1 via fxp0.0
100.123.0.0/16     *[Direct/0] 00:39:23
                    > via fxp0.0
100.123.1.2/32     *[Local/0] 00:39:23
                      Local via fxp0.0
200.0.13.0/30       *[Direct/0] 00:26:41
                    > via ge-0/0/2.0
200.0.13.2/32       *[Local/0] 00:26:41
                      Local via ge-0/0/2.0

6) As we can see, Host3 doesn't have any private IP subnets listed in its route table, and the default route is setup in the lab 
through fxp0.0 most likely for reachbility through the management network to the device. This is a normal configuration. Lets now 
setup a NAT policy on the firewall to perform NAT so that traffic sourced from any inside private IP (10.100.0.0/16) uses a predifined
Pool of IPs. This is common practice for companies who allocate an IP subnet to be used for their NAT policy for external reachability.
Furthermore we will simulate that the subnet in which the pool of NAT IP's is being advertised to the External client (Host3) by putting
a static route in the route table on Host3.

Add the static route inside Host3:

jcluser@Host3# set routing-options static route 1.1.1.0/30 next-hop 200.0.13.1   

vSRX configuration:

Define the Pool:

set security nat source pool Pool1 address 1.1.1.0/30

Define the interfaces that the pool will use, in this case we'll keep it simple and define the IPs on a loopback interface:

set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 1.1.1.1/32
set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 1.1.1.2/32
set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 1.1.1.3/32
set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 1.1.1.0/32

Define the security zones the NAT policy should use:

set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST from zone trust
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST to zone untrust

Define the NAT Policy:

set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL_NAT match source-address 10.100.0.0/16
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL_NAT match destination-address 0.0.0.0/0
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL_NAT then source-nat pool Pool1

7) Try to ping again from the internal Host1 client to the external client Host3:

jcluser@Host1> ping 200.0.13.2 rapid count 5    
PING 200.0.13.2 (200.0.13.2): 56 data bytes
!!!!!
--- 200.0.13.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 1.337/1.793/3.161/0.691 ms

8) It works! Lets look at some show commands on the vSRX to verify connectivity:

  Translation hits           : 10
    Successful sessions      : 10
  Number of sessions         : 0

9) We can see from the security flow session command that the PING/ICMP traffic is hitting the NAT policy. The traffic
from Host1 has a source of 10.100.11.2 as it enters into the firewall. It then hits the NAT policy and gets NATd to one
of the IPs inside the IP Pool we defined. We see that this is true because the traffic coming back to the firewall from
Host3 (200.0.13.2) has an IP address of 1.1.1.2 or 1.1.1.3 as seen in the above output. 

We can also see from the "show security nat source rule" command that we are seeing hit counts on the rule, so we are 
good to go now!

10) Lets try to ping from Host2 to Host3 after we put in a static route to the destination (for reachability) to see if 
we see Host2 using the NAT Policy/Rule as well:

jcluser@Host2# set routing-options static route 200.0.13.0/30 next-hop 10.100.12.1


jcluser@Host2> ping 200.0.13.2 rapid count 5

12) We can see from the security flow session command that the PING/ICMP traffic is hitting the NAT policy. The traffic
from Host2 has a source of 10.100.12.2 as it enters into the firewall. It then hits the NAT policy and gets NATd to one
of the IPs inside the IP Pool we defined. We see that this is true because the traffic coming back to the firewall from
Host3 (200.0.13.2) has an IP address of 1.1.1.3 or 1.1.1.0 as seen in the above output. The NAT rule hit count also
increase by 5 packets, which is further confirmation that the NAT Policy is working.

13) Last activity, lets redo the NAT Policy so that traffic sourced from the Host1 subnet (10.100.11.0/24) is translated
and uses a different NAT policy than traffic sourced from the Host2 subnet (10.100.12.0/24).

Lets start off by defining our new NAT pool, Pool2:

jcluser@vSRX1# set security nat source pool Pool2 address 2.2.2.2/32 

Lets create the new loopback interface to host the NAT traffic:

jcluser@vSRX1# set interfaces lo0.0 family inet address 2.2.2.2/32 

Lets delete the old NAT policy:

delete security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST

Lets create the new NAT policy:

jcluser@vSRX1#
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL1_NAT match source-address 10.100.11.0/24
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL1_NAT match destination-address 0.0.0.0/0
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL1_NAT then source-nat pool Pool1
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL2_NAT match source-address 10.100.12.0/24
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL2_NAT match destination-address 0.0.0.0/0
set security nat source rule-set INTERNAL_HOSTS_TO_UNTRUST rule IP_POOL2_NAT then source-nat pool Pool2

Last off, lets create the route in Host3 to allow for return traffic to Host2 via the new loopback address (2.2.2.2/32)

jcluser@Host3# set routing-options static route 2.2.2.2/32 next-hop 200.0.13.1 

14) Lets test our ping traffic from Host1 and Host2 and see what happens now:

15) The traffic is now hitting the two different NAT rules based upon the source address match condition and therefore
using different NAT Pools as intended. Congratulations, you have completed the lab!
